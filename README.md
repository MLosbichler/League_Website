DISCLAIMER\n
This project is a practice project and not intended to be used for any other purposes. My goal is to improve my skills in Web-Development, as I´m about to finish my Bachelor´s Degree and this is the direction I want to start my career with afterwards.
My focus will be on getting to know the later listed technologies (some of which I have already used for a Uni project before) and gaining more experience in creating and building projects, while trying to implement best practices as much as I can.

PROJECT SUMMARY
This is a website targeting League of Legends players. While there is a functionality in the game that allows you to compare your rank to everyone in your friend list, you oftentimes just want to compare yourself with some of your friends you usually play with.
This website aims to target this issue, offering the creation of groups. These groups list a leaderboard of invited players, who have to create accounts using Discord. They can link multiple League of Legends accounts to their website account.

PROJECT GOALS
1  -WIP--  Create working calls to the Riot Games API using the Orianna framework. Create a database table to save League of Legends accounts, their crucial data and their current rating.
2  -TODO-  Work out account-creation using Discord.
3  -TODO-  Implement the ability to create and join groups.
4  -TODO-  Create a Frontend. (doesn´t have to be fancy at this point, just functioning with the intended layout)
5  -TODO-  Implement the Backend API functionality to enable data transferation with the Frontend.
6  -TODO-  Make Frontend fancier.
7  ------  Additional goals.

USED TECHNOLOGY
Database:  PostgreSQL
Backend:   Spring Boot (Java)
